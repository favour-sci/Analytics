This Project is for the Maven Pizza Challenge, where I played the role of a BI Consultant hired by Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey to help the restaurant use data to improve operations.
The purpose is to analyze the data and put together a report to help Plato's Pizza find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.
